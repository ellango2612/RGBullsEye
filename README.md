## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

A list of my favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app:

1. Instagram
- Contains lots of visual features (images)
- Interactive -> enable communicating with other users

2. Evernote:
- Organization: This app allows me to keep my thoughts, ideas, and important information well-organized.
- Cross-Platform Sync: I can access my notes on my laptop, smartphone, or tablet, making it convenient to work on the go.

3. Spotify:
- Extensive number of choices with a vast collection of songs, albums, and playlists.
- Personalized Recommendations: It provides tailored song recommendations and Discover Weekly playlists based on my listening history, thereby introducing me to new artists and songs I might enjoy.

4. Duolingo:
- Gamified Language Learning: Duolingo turns language learning into a fun and engaging game with levels, rewards, and achievements, making the process enjoyable and motivating.

5. Google Maps:
- Accurate Navigation: Google Maps provides accurate turn-by-turn navigation, helping me find the best routes and avoid traffic, whether I'm driving, walking, or using public transportation.
- Real-Time Updates: The app offers real-time updates on traffic conditions and estimated arrival times, ensuring I can plan my trips efficiently.

An app idea that I would like to build:

LearnNewWords app. It is a language learning app that enables users to learn different languages unfamiliar to them. It might be interactive (allowing users to communicate with one another) or not. It should have lots of visual aids (images) for language learning and also audio features like google translate.


## Notes

I had troubles understanding and getting around to play with Swift ans Swift code, but thanks to the book I read and the thorough tutorial, I was able to get to this point. A lot of thanks to "SwiftUI by Tutorials"
